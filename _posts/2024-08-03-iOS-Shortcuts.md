<h3><ins>Overview</ins></h3>

<p>The Pomodoro technique is a time management system that involves breaking down work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique is named after the Italian word for tomato, as the inventor, Francesco Cirillo, used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to time his work intervals.</p>
<p>The purpose of using a Pomodoro timer is to help you break your work into manageable, focused segments, allowing you to stay focused and productive without becoming overwhelmed. By using a timer, you remove the need to constantly check the clock or be distracted by other tasks, as you know that you have a set amount of time in which to work before you can take a break.</p>
<p>Using a Pomodoro timer can also help you to prioritize your work, as you can decide which tasks to work on in each interval and ensure that you are making progress towards your goals. Additionally, taking regular breaks can help to reduce stress and prevent burnout, as well as improve your overall well-being and productivity.</p>
