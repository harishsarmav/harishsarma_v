Like many of us, I was caught in the loop.

Every day felt incomplete without playing **FIFA Mobile**, keeping up with **Snapchat streaks**, and diving deep into the black hole of **Instagram reels**. What started as a few minutes of fun turned into hours of my time — every single day.

And then one day, I just said: **Enough.**

## 🎮 The Problem

- **FIFA Mobile** wasn't just a game anymore — it was a *compulsion*. Win, lose, rage quit, repeat.
- **Snapchat streaks**? They felt more like a *chore* than a connection.
- **Instagram reels** — 10 minutes would turn into 2 hours. Dopamine hits that never lasted.

All of it was robbing me of time, energy, and focus. I realized I wasn’t being present in my real life anymore.

## 🛑 The Turning Point

The biggest wake-up call?  
I looked at my screen time — and the numbers didn’t lie. I was spending more time maintaining digital habits than on anything that actually *mattered* to me.

I asked myself:
> "Is this really how I want to live my days?"

That simple question changed everything.

## 🔁 What I Did

Here’s what helped me break free:

- **Uninstalled the apps** — cold turkey. Painful for a few days, liberating after.
- **Disabled notifications** for everything non-essential.
- **Started a simple habit tracker** to record positive actions like workouts, coding hours, reading.
- **Replaced the time** with things I used to *say* I had “no time” for:
  - Going on walks
  - Learning new tech
  - Reading books
  - Sleeping better!

## 🧠 What I Learned

- You don’t have to “delete forever” — just take back **control**.
- The urge fades when you replace it with purpose.
- Real-world wins feel **way better** than any streak or rank.

## 🚀 Where I Am Now

I’m not perfect. I still use social media occasionally — but with intention.

What I gained in return:
- **More clarity**
- **Better mental health**
- **Time to code, write, and grow**
- **Genuine connections offline**

And most importantly, I feel **more like myself** again.

If you’re stuck in the loop, I hope this post gives you the nudge to pause and reset. Trust me — it’s worth it.

*You don’t have to quit everything. Just start by choosing you.*
